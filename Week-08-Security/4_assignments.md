# Week 8 Assignments

1) Add a new endpoint `/api/user/profile` that only authenticated users can access.  

2) Switch from in-memory users to a database-backed `UserDetailsService`.  

3) Implement JWT authentication for login, issuing a token to the client.  

4) Secure all recipe endpoints so only authenticated users can CRUD recipes.  

5) (Stretch) Add method-level security with `@PreAuthorize` to restrict deleting recipes to admins.
